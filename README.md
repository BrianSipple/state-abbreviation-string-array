State Abbreviation String Array
===================================

From brute force to open source... I needed to make a comma-separated array consisting solely of state abbreviation strings. I couldn't find it on Google or GitHub already, so here it is for anyone else who might have the same need.

###Notes
- Each 2-letter code adheres to the ANSI standard INCITS 38:2009
- "DC" is included for District of Columbia
- US territories and commonwealths are also included: "AS" (American Samoa), "GU" (Guam), "MP" (Northern Mariana Islands), "PR" (Puerto Rico), "VI" (Virgin Islands)
